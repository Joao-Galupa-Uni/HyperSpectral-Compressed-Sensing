# HyperSpectral Compressed Sensing Simulation

> This work was done under the supervision of professor André Moitinho. It was developed for the course "Modelação e Simulação em Engenharia" for the Masters' in Physics Engineering at Faculdade de Cieências da Universidade de Lisboa.

This project simulates the uses of a Compressed Imaging device, that uses a DMD to project the image with Hadamard independent vectors and implements a prism to divide the image in its light bands, which would be captured by a CCD.

It also presents an algorithm to reconstruct the initial image from a part of the values given by the reprojection with Hadamard vectors and tests its usability.
